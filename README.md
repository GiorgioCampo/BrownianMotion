# Brownian Motion

This repository stores the results from the assignment of the course Non-Equilibrium Statistical Physics from UvA. 
The objective of the assignment is to exlpore the properties of a 1-dimensional Brownian particle in a thermal bath, and to gain insights about its motion in time through statistical analysis.

For all the results, please read the Results.pdf file.
